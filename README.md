# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) based on the MNIST dataset. It includes a training pipeline, model testing, and a Flask web interface for real-time digit prediction.

## Features

- Trains a CNN on MNIST data
- Predicts digit from uploaded image
- Web interface using Flask
- Model testing with accuracy reporting

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
